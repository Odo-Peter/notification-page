- Select "Mark all as read" to toggle the visual state of the unread notifications and set the number of unread messages to zero
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Javascript

### What I learned

This challenge has taught me the importance of a proper markup and the power of CSS, alongside media queries, also, learnt about the proper use of the forEach loop, a higher order function in JavaScript and further implementing it with JavaScript.

The challenge has also improved my knowledge, in terms of using markdown files and in committing a file to github, basically working with the command line has improved some more, all thanks to this and other frontend mentor's challenge worked on.

### Continued development

In future projects or challenges, I'ld love to add more javascript functions that will toggle the color scheme, to probably a dark and light mode.
